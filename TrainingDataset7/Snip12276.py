def split_exclude(self, filter_expr, can_reuse, names_with_path):
        """
        When doing an exclude against any kind of N-to-many relation, we need
        to use a subquery. This method constructs the nested query, given the
        original exclude filter (filter_expr) and the portion up to the first
        N-to-many relation field.

        For example, if the origin filter is ~Q(child__name='foo'), filter_expr
        is ('child__name', 'foo') and can_reuse is a set of joins usable for
        filters in the original query.

        We will turn this into equivalent of:
            WHERE NOT EXISTS(
                SELECT 1
                FROM child
                WHERE name = 'foo' AND child.parent_id = parent.id
                LIMIT 1
