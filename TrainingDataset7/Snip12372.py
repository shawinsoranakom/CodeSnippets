def mark_for_rollback_on_error(using=None):
    """
    Internal low-level utility to mark a transaction as "needs rollback" when
    an exception is raised while not enforcing the enclosed block to be in a
    transaction. This is needed by Model.save() and friends to avoid starting a
    transaction when in autocommit mode and a single query is executed.

    It's equivalent to:

        connection = get_connection(using)
        if connection.get_autocommit():
            yield
        else:
            with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=False):
                yield

    but it uses low-level utilities to avoid performance overhead.
