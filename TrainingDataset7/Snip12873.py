    Validate the given host for this site.

    Check that the host looks valid and matches a host or host pattern in the
    given list of ``allowed_hosts``. Any pattern beginning with a period
    matches a domain and all its subdomains (e.g. ``.example.com`` matches
    ``example.com`` and any subdomain), ``*`` matches anything, and anything
    else must match exactly.

    Note: This function assumes that the given host is lowercased and has
    already had the port, if any, stripped off.

    Return ``True`` for a valid host, ``False`` otherwise.
