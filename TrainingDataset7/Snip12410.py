def send_robust(self, sender, **named):
        """
        Send signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.

        If any receivers are asynchronous, they are called after all the
        synchronous receivers via a single call to async_to_sync(). They are
        also executed concurrently with asyncio.TaskGroup().

        Arguments:

            sender
                The sender of the signal. Can be any Python object (normally
                one registered with a connect if you actually want something to
                occur).

            named
                Named arguments which will be passed to receivers.

        Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].

        If any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of
        Exception), return the error instance as the result for that receiver.
