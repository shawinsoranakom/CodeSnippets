    Return a dictionary mapping command names to their callback applications.

    Look for a management.commands package in django.core, and in each
    installed application -- if a commands package exists, register all
    commands in that package.

    Core commands are always included. If a settings module has been
    specified, also include user-defined commands.

    The dictionary is in the format {command_name: app_name}. Key-value
    pairs from this dictionary can then be used in calls to
    load_command_class(app_name, command_name)

    The dictionary is cached on the first call and reused on subsequent
    calls.
