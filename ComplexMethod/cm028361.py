  """Position-sensitive crop and pool rectangular regions from a feature grid.

  The output crops are split into `spatial_bins_y` vertical bins
  and `spatial_bins_x` horizontal bins. For each intersection of a vertical
  and a horizontal bin the output values are gathered by performing
  `tf.image.crop_and_resize` (bilinear resampling) on a a separate subset of
  channels of the image. This reduces `depth` by a factor of
  `(spatial_bins_y * spatial_bins_x)`.

  When global_pool is True, this function implements a differentiable version
  of position-sensitive RoI pooling used in
  [R-FCN detection system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06409).

  When global_pool is False, this function implements a differentiable version
  of position-sensitive assembling operation used in
  [instance FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08678).

  Args:
    image: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `int8`,
      `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`.
      A 3-D tensor of shape `[image_height, image_width, depth]`.
      Both `image_height` and `image_width` need to be positive.
    boxes: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
      A 2-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`. Each box is specified in
      normalized coordinates `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`. A normalized coordinate value
      of `y` is mapped to the image coordinate at `y * (image_height - 1)`, so
      as the `[0, 1]` interval of normalized image height is mapped to
      `[0, image_height - 1] in image height coordinates. We do allow y1 > y2,
      in which case the sampled crop is an up-down flipped version of the
      original image. The width dimension is treated similarly.
    crop_size: A list of two integers `[crop_height, crop_width]`. All
      cropped image patches are resized to this size. The aspect ratio of the
      image content is not preserved. Both `crop_height` and `crop_width` need
      to be positive.
    num_spatial_bins: A list of two integers `[spatial_bins_y, spatial_bins_x]`.
      Represents the number of position-sensitive bins in y and x directions.
      Both values should be >= 1. `crop_height` should be divisible by
      `spatial_bins_y`, and similarly for width.
      The number of image channels should be divisible by
      (spatial_bins_y * spatial_bins_x).
      Suggested value from R-FCN paper: [3, 3].
    global_pool: A boolean variable.
      If True, we perform average global pooling on the features assembled from
        the position-sensitive score maps.
      If False, we keep the position-pooled features without global pooling
        over the spatial coordinates.
      Note that using global_pool=True is equivalent to but more efficient than
        running the function with global_pool=False and then performing global
        average pooling.

  Returns:
    position_sensitive_features: A 4-D tensor of shape
      `[num_boxes, K, K, crop_channels]`,
      where `crop_channels = depth / (spatial_bins_y * spatial_bins_x)`,
      where K = 1 when global_pool is True (Average-pooled cropped regions),
      and K = crop_size when global_pool is False.
  Raises:
    ValueError: Raised in four situations:
      `num_spatial_bins` is not >= 1;
      `num_spatial_bins` does not divide `crop_size`;
      `(spatial_bins_y*spatial_bins_x)` does not divide `depth`;
      `bin_crop_size` is not square when global_pool=False due to the
        constraint in function space_to_depth.
