        request to happen.

        The baseline implementation is a simple linear login cooldown: after
        a number of failures trying to log-in, the user (by login) is put on
        cooldown. During the cooldown period, login *attempts* are ignored
        and logged.

        :param user: user id or login, for logging purpose

        .. warning::

            The login counter is not shared between workers and not
            specifically thread-safe, the feature exists mostly for
            rate-limiting on large number of login attempts (brute-forcing
            passwords) so that should not be much of an issue.

            For a more complex strategy (e.g. database or distribute storage)
            override this method. To simply change the cooldown criteria
            (configuration, ...) override _on_login_cooldown instead.

        .. note::

            This is a *context manager* so it can be called around the login
            procedure without having to call it itself.
