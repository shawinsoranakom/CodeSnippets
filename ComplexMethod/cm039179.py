    """
    Builds a single-linkage tree (SLT) from the input data `X`. If
    `metric="precomputed"` then `X` must be a symmetric array of distances.
    Otherwise, the pairwise distances are calculated directly and passed to
    `mutual_reachability_graph`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        Either the raw data from which to compute the pairwise distances,
        or the precomputed distances.

    min_samples : int, default=None
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point
        to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.

    alpha : float, default=1.0
        A distance scaling parameter as used in robust single linkage.

    metric : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array.

        - If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
          the options allowed by :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`
          for its metric parameter.

        - If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
          must be square.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for computing the pairwise distances. This
        works by breaking down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and
        computing them in parallel. This parameter is passed directly to
        :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    copy : bool, default=False
        If `copy=True` then any time an in-place modifications would be made
        that would overwrite `X`, a copy will first be made, guaranteeing that
        the original data will be unchanged. Currently, it only applies when
        `metric="precomputed"`, when passing a dense array or a CSR sparse
        array/matrix.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Arguments passed to the distance metric.

    Returns
    -------
    single_linkage : ndarray of shape (n_samples - 1,), dtype=HIERARCHY_dtype
        The single-linkage tree tree (dendrogram) built from the MST.
