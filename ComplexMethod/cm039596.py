    """Returns the MSE for the models computed by 'path'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training data.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
        Target values.

    sample_weight : None or array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Sample weights.

    train : list of indices
        The indices of the train set.

    test : list of indices
        The indices of the test set.

    path : callable
        Function returning a list of models on the path. See
        enet_path for an example of signature.

    path_params : dictionary
        Parameters passed to the path function.

    alphas : array-like, default=None
        Array of float that is used for cross-validation. If not
        provided, computed using 'path'.

    l1_ratio : float, default=1
        float between 0 and 1 passed to ElasticNet (scaling between
        l1 and l2 penalties). For ``l1_ratio = 0`` the penalty is an
        L2 penalty. For ``l1_ratio = 1`` it is an L1 penalty. For ``0
        < l1_ratio < 1``, the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2.

    X_order : {'F', 'C'}, default=None
        The order of the arrays expected by the path function to
        avoid memory copies.

    dtype : a numpy dtype, default=None
        The dtype of the arrays expected by the path function to
        avoid memory copies.
