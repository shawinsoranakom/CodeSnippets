    A simple all_gather primitive with basic synchronization guard logic,
    by checking payload from all ranks has the same stage name.

    Args:
        data_or_fn: the data to be all gathered across ranks or function to be executed
        stage_name: the sync stage name for out-of-sync protection
        pg: the process group for sync
    Throws:

    Returns:
        a list of synced data from all ranks
