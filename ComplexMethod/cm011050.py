        Updates the scale factor.
        If any optimizer steps were skipped the scale is multiplied by ``backoff_factor``
        to reduce it. If ``growth_interval`` unskipped iterations occurred consecutively,
        the scale is multiplied by ``growth_factor`` to increase it.
        Passing ``new_scale`` sets the new scale value manually. (``new_scale`` is not
        used directly, it's used to fill GradScaler's internal scale tensor. So if
        ``new_scale`` was a tensor, later in-place changes to that tensor will not further
        affect the scale GradScaler uses internally.)
