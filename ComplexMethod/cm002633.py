    Calculates a spectrogram over one waveform using the Short-Time Fourier Transform.

    This function can create the following kinds of spectrograms:

      - amplitude spectrogram (`power = 1.0`)
      - power spectrogram (`power = 2.0`)
      - complex-valued spectrogram (`power = None`)
      - log spectrogram (use `log_mel` argument)
      - mel spectrogram (provide `mel_filters`)
      - log-mel spectrogram (provide `mel_filters` and `log_mel`)

    How this works:

      1. The input waveform is split into frames of size `frame_length` that are partially overlapping by `frame_length
         - hop_length` samples.
      2. Each frame is multiplied by the window and placed into a buffer of size `fft_length`.
      3. The DFT is taken of each windowed frame.
      4. The results are stacked into a spectrogram.

    We make a distinction between the following "blocks" of sample data, each of which may have a different lengths:

      - The analysis frame. This is the size of the time slices that the input waveform is split into.
      - The window. Each analysis frame is multiplied by the window to avoid spectral leakage.
      - The FFT input buffer. The length of this determines how many frequency bins are in the spectrogram.

    In this implementation, the window is assumed to be zero-padded to have the same size as the analysis frame. A
    padded window can be obtained from `window_function()`. The FFT input buffer may be larger than the analysis frame,
    typically the next power of two.

    Note: This function is not optimized for speed yet. It should be mostly compatible with `librosa.stft` and
    `torchaudio.functional.transforms.Spectrogram`, although it is more flexible due to the different ways spectrograms
    can be constructed.

    Args:
        waveform (`np.ndarray` of shape `(length,)`):
            The input waveform. This must be a single real-valued, mono waveform.
        window (`np.ndarray` of shape `(frame_length,)`):
            The windowing function to apply, including zero-padding if necessary. The actual window length may be
            shorter than `frame_length`, but we're assuming the array has already been zero-padded.
        frame_length (`int`):
            The length of the analysis frames in samples. With librosa this is always equal to `fft_length` but we also
            allow smaller sizes.
        hop_length (`int`):
            The stride between successive analysis frames in samples.
        fft_length (`int`, *optional*):
            The size of the FFT buffer in samples. This determines how many frequency bins the spectrogram will have.
            For optimal speed, this should be a power of two. If `None`, uses `frame_length`.
        power (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            If 1.0, returns the amplitude spectrogram. If 2.0, returns the power spectrogram. If `None`, returns
            complex numbers.
        center (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to pad the waveform so that frame `t` is centered around time `t * hop_length`. If `False`, frame
            `t` will start at time `t * hop_length`.
        pad_mode (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"reflect"`):
            Padding mode used when `center` is `True`. Possible values are: `"constant"` (pad with zeros), `"edge"`
            (pad with edge values), `"reflect"` (pads with mirrored values).
        onesided (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If True, only computes the positive frequencies and returns a spectrogram containing `fft_length // 2 + 1`
            frequency bins. If False, also computes the negative frequencies and returns `fft_length` frequency bins.
        dither (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Adds dithering. In other words, adds a small Gaussian noise to each frame.
            E.g. use 4.0 to add dithering with a normal distribution centered
            around 0.0 with standard deviation 4.0, 0.0 means no dithering.
            Dithering has similar effect as `mel_floor`. It reduces the high log_mel_fbank
            values for signals with hard-zero sections, when VAD cutoff is present in the signal.
        preemphasis (`float`, *optional*)
            Coefficient for a low-pass filter that applies pre-emphasis before the DFT.
        mel_filters (`np.ndarray` of shape `(num_freq_bins, num_mel_filters)`, *optional*):
            The mel filter bank. If supplied, applies a this filter bank to create a mel spectrogram.
        mel_floor (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-10):
            Minimum value of mel frequency banks.
        log_mel (`str`, *optional*):
            How to convert the spectrogram to log scale. Possible options are: `None` (don't convert), `"log"` (take
            the natural logarithm) `"log10"` (take the base-10 logarithm), `"dB"` (convert to decibels). Can only be
            used when `power` is not `None`.
        reference (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Sets the input spectrogram value that corresponds to 0 dB. For example, use `np.max(spectrogram)` to set
            the loudest part to 0 dB. Must be greater than zero.
        min_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1e-10`):
            The spectrogram will be clipped to this minimum value before conversion to decibels, to avoid taking
            `log(0)`. For a power spectrogram, the default of `1e-10` corresponds to a minimum of -100 dB. For an
            amplitude spectrogram, the value `1e-5` corresponds to -100 dB. Must be greater than zero.
        db_range (`float`, *optional*):
            Sets the maximum dynamic range in decibels. For example, if `db_range = 80`, the difference between the
            peak value and the smallest value will never be more than 80 dB. Must be greater than zero.
        remove_dc_offset (`bool`, *optional*):
            Subtract mean from waveform on each frame, applied before pre-emphasis. This should be set to `true` in
            order to get the same results as `torchaudio.compliance.kaldi.fbank` when computing mel filters.
        dtype (`np.dtype`, *optional*, defaults to `np.float32`):
            Data type of the spectrogram tensor. If `power` is None, this argument is ignored and the dtype will be
            `np.complex64`.

    Returns:
        `nd.array` containing a spectrogram of shape `(num_frequency_bins, length)` for a regular spectrogram or shape
        `(num_mel_filters, length)` for a mel spectrogram.
