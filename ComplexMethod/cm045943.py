        Group the decoded characters and record the corresponding decoded positions.

                        - 'en&num': continuous english characters (e.g., hello), number (e.g., 123, 1.123), or mixed of them connected by '-' (e.g., VGG-16)
                        The remaining characters in text are treated as separators between groups (e.g., space, '(', ')', etc.).
