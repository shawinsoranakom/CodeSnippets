            # `tensor.element_size() > 1`. Let's say that `tensor.dtype ==
            # torch.float`.  The storage will be serialized with element size
            # of 1, since we're choosing to serialize the first occurrence of
            # a duplicate storage. Since this legacy serialization format saves
            # the numel of the storage, rather than nbytes directly, we'll be
            # effectively saving nbytes in this case.  We'll be able to load it
            # and the tensor back up with no problems in _this_ and future
            # versions of pytorch, but in older versions, here's the problem:
            # the storage will be loaded up as a UntypedStorage, and then the
            # FloatTensor will loaded and the UntypedStorage will be assigned to
            # it. Since the storage dtype does not match the tensor dtype, this
            # will cause an error.  If we reverse the list, like `[tensor,
            # storage]`, then we will save the `tensor.storage()` as a faked
            # `FloatStorage`, and the saved size will be the correct
            # dtype-specific numel count that old versions expect. `tensor`
            # will be able to load up properly in old versions, pointing to
            # a FloatStorage. However, `storage` is still being translated to
            # a UntypedStorage, and it will try to resolve to the same
            # FloatStorage that `tensor` contains. This will also cause an
            # error. It doesn't seem like there's any way around this.
            # Probably, we just cannot maintain FC for the legacy format if the
            # saved list contains both a tensor and a storage that point to the
