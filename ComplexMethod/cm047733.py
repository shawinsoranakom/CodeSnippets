        """Crop and resize the image.

        The image is never resized above the current image size. This method is
        only to create smaller versions of the image.

        Instead of preserving the ratio of the original image like `resize`,
        this method will force the output to take the ratio of the given
        `max_width` and `max_height`, so both have to be defined.

        The crop is done before the resize in order to preserve as much of the
        original image as possible. The goal of this method is primarily to
        resize to a given ratio, and it is not to crop unwanted parts of the
        original image. If the latter is what you want to do, you should create
        another method, or directly use the `crop` method from PIL.

        It is currently not supported for GIF because we do not handle all the
        frames properly.

            (bottom). Defaults to 0.5 (center).
