        - be equal, eg ``/contact/on-site`` vs ``/contact/on-site``

        considered a corner case, and the following applies:

        - anchor/fragment are ignored during the comparison (it would be
          impossible to compare anyway as the client is not sending the anchor
          to the server as per RFC)
        - query string parameters should be the same to be considered equal, as
