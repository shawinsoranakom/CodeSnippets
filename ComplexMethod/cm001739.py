        Util for integration test.

        Text is tokenized and then reverted back to text. Both results are then checked.

        Args:
            expected_encoding:
                The expected result of the tokenizer output.
            model_name:
                The model name of the tokenizer to load and use.
            revision:
                The full git revision number of the model. This is to pin the
                tokenizer config and to avoid that tests start to fail if the
                config gets changed upstream.
            sequences:
                Can overwrite the texts that are used to check the tokenizer.
                This is useful if the tokenizer supports non english languages
                like france.
            decode_kwargs:
                Additional args for the ``decode`` function which reverts the
                tokenized text back to a string.
            padding:
                Activates and controls padding of the tokenizer.
