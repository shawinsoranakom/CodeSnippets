def _build_attention_equation(rank, attn_axes):
    """Builds einsum equations for the attention computation.

    Query, key, value inputs after projection are expected to have the shape as:
    `(bs, <non-attention dims>, <attention dims>, num_heads, channels)`.
    `bs` and `<non-attention dims>` are treated as `<batch dims>`.

    The attention operations can be generalized:
    1. Query-key dot product:
        (<batch dims>, <query attention dims>, num_heads, channels),
        (<batch dims>, <key attention dims>, num_heads, channels) ->
        (<batch dims>, num_heads, <query attention dims>, <key attention dims>)
    2. Combination:
        (<batch dims>, num_heads, <query attention dims>, <key attention dims>),
        (<batch dims>, <value attention dims>, num_heads, channels) -> (<batch
        dims>, <query attention dims>, num_heads, channels)

    Args:
        rank: Rank of query, key, value tensors.
        attn_axes: List/tuple of axes, `[-1, rank)`,
            that attention will be applied to.

    Returns:
        Einsum equations.
