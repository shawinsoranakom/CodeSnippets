    If the number of layers is not divisible by the number of partitions,

    partition. The last partition is excluded because it often contains an
    additional norm layer and we are attempting to balance compute.

    `0 < x <= pp_size - 2` then the remaining layers are evenly distributed
    across the middle partitions. The first and last partitions are excluded
