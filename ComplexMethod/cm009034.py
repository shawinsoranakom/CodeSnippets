        """Check for parallel write_todos tool calls and return errors if detected.

        The todo list is designed to be updated at most once per model turn. Since
        the `write_todos` tool replaces the entire todo list with each call, making
        multiple parallel calls would create ambiguity about which update should take
        precedence. This method prevents such conflicts by rejecting any response that
        contains multiple write_todos tool calls.

        Args:
            state: The current agent state containing messages.
            runtime: The LangGraph runtime instance.

        Returns:
            A dict containing error ToolMessages for each write_todos call if multiple
            parallel calls are detected, otherwise None to allow normal execution.
