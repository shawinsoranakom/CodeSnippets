    r"""Compute the multi margin loss, with optional weighting.

    See :class:`~torch.nn.MultiMarginLoss` for details.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): Predicted values.
        target (Tensor): Ground truth values.
        p (int, optional): Has a default value of 1. 1 and 2 are the only supported values.
        margin (float, optional): Margin for multi margin loss. Has a default value of 1.
        weight (Tensor, optional): Weights for each sample. Default: None.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
                                  'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'mean': the mean of the output is taken.
                                  'sum': the output will be summed. 'none': no reduction will be applied.
                                  Default: 'mean'.

    Returns:
        Tensor: Multi margin loss (optionally weighted).
