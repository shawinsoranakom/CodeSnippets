def partition_graph(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> set[tuple[str, str]]:
    """
    Partitions a graph using Karger's Algorithm. Implemented from
    pseudocode found here:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm.
    This function involves random choices, meaning it will not give
    consistent outputs.

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary containing adacency lists for the graph.
            Nodes must be strings.

    Returns:
        The cutset of the cut found by Karger's Algorithm.

    >>> graph = {'0':['1'], '1':['0']}
    >>> partition_graph(graph)
