def _parse_spec(spec, knownids=None, section=None):
    """Yield an info tuple for each module corresponding to the given spec.

    The info consists of: (frozenid, pyfile, modname, ispkg, section).

    Supported formats:

      frozenid
      frozenid : modname
      frozenid : modname = pyfile

    "frozenid" and "modname" must be valid module names (dot-separated
    identifiers).  If "modname" is not provided then "frozenid" is used.
    If "pyfile" is not provided then the filename of the module
    corresponding to "frozenid" is used.

    Angle brackets around a frozenid (e.g. '<encodings>") indicate
    it is a package.  This also means it must be an actual module
    (i.e. "pyfile" cannot have been provided).  Such values can have
    patterns to expand submodules:

      <encodings.*>    - also freeze all direct submodules
      <encodings.**.*> - also freeze the full submodule tree

    As with "frozenid", angle brackets around "modname" indicate
    it is a package.  However, in this case "pyfile" should not
    have been provided and patterns in "modname" are not supported.
    Also, if "modname" has brackets then "frozenid" should not,
    and "pyfile" should have been provided..
