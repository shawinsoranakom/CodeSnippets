def _compute_reference(self, provider_code, prefix=None, separator='-', **kwargs):
        """ Compute a unique reference for the transaction.

        The reference corresponds to the prefix if no other transaction with that prefix already
        exists. Otherwise, it follows the pattern `{computed_prefix}{separator}{sequence_number}`
        where:

        - `{computed_prefix}` is:

          - The provided custom prefix, if any.
          - The computation result of :meth:`_compute_reference_prefix` if the custom prefix is not
            filled, but the kwargs are.
          - `'tx-{datetime}'` if neither the custom prefix nor the kwargs are filled.

        - `{separator}` is the string that separates the prefix from the sequence number.
        - `{sequence_number}` is the next integer in the sequence of references sharing the same
          prefix. The sequence starts with `1` if there is only one matching reference.

        .. example::

           - Given the custom prefix `'example'` which has no match with an existing reference, the
             full reference will be `'example'`.
           - Given the custom prefix `'example'` which matches the existing reference `'example'`,
             and the custom separator `'-'`, the full reference will be `'example-1'`.
           - Given the kwargs `{'invoice_ids': [1, 2]}`, the custom separator `'-'` and no custom
             prefix, the full reference will be `'INV1-INV2'` (or similar) if no existing reference
             has the same prefix, or `'INV1-INV2-n'` if `n` existing references have the same
             prefix.

        :param str prefix: The custom prefix used to compute the full reference.
