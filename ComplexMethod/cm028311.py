  """Concatenate list of BoxLists.

  This op concatenates a list of input BoxLists into a larger BoxList.  It also
  handles concatenation of BoxList fields as long as the field tensor shapes
  are equal except for the first dimension.

  Args:
    boxlists: list of BoxList objects
    fields: optional list of fields to also concatenate.  By default, all
      fields from the first BoxList in the list are included in the
      concatenation.
    scope: name scope.

  Returns:
    a BoxList with number of boxes equal to
      sum([boxlist.num_boxes() for boxlist in BoxList])
  Raises:
    ValueError: if boxlists is invalid (i.e., is not a list, is empty, or
      contains non BoxList objects), or if requested fields are not contained in
      all boxlists
