def hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, *, labels=None, sample_weight=None):
    """Average hinge loss (non-regularized).

    In :term:`binary` class case, assuming labels in `y_true` are encoded with +1
    and -1, when a prediction mistake is made, `margin = y_true * pred_decision` is
    always negative (since the signs are opposite), implying `1 - margin` is
    always greater than 1.  The cumulated hinge loss is therefore an upper
    bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    In :term:`multiclass` case, the function expects that either all the labels are
    present in `y_true` or an optional `labels` argument is provided which
    contains all the labels. The multiclass margin is calculated according
    to Crammer-Singer's method. As in the binary case, the cumulated hinge loss
    is an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True target. For :term:`binary` data, it should only contain two unique
        values, with the positive label being greater than the negative label.
        For :term:`multiclass` data, all labels should be present, or provided
        via `labels`.

    pred_decision : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Predicted decisions, as output by :term:`decision_function` (floats).

    labels : array-like, default=None
        Contains all the labels for the problem. Used in multiclass hinge loss.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float
        Average hinge loss.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn import svm
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import hinge_loss
    >>> X = [[0], [1]]
    >>> y = [-1, 1]
    >>> est = svm.LinearSVC(random_state=0)
    >>> est.fit(X, y)
    LinearSVC(random_state=0)
    >>> pred_decision = est.decision_function([[-2], [3], [0.5]])
    >>> pred_decision
    array([-2.18,  2.36,  0.09])
    >>> hinge_loss([-1, 1, 1], pred_decision)
    0.30

    In the multiclass case:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
    >>> Y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> labels = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> est = svm.LinearSVC()
    >>> est.fit(X, Y)
    LinearSVC()
    >>> pred_decision = est.decision_function([[-1], [2], [3]])
    >>> y_true = [0, 2, 3]
    >>> hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, labels=labels)
