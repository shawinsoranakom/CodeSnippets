    Each process splits input tensor and then scatters the split list

    the processes in the group and return single output tensor.

    Group can be one of:
        List[int]: ranks participating in the collective.
        List[List[int]]: 2D mesh of ranks taking part of this collective in MPMD.
        ProcessGroup: Will perform a collective using the ranks and tag of the PG.
        DeviceMesh: Do a SPMD collective over all ranks of the mesh
        (DeviceMesh, int): Do a MPMD collective over one dimension of the DeviceMesh

    :: N.B. If you pass a PG or a 1D list to perform a MPMD collective, the compiler won't be able to recover
    that information and perform collective algebraic optimization. Use other forms of input for that.
