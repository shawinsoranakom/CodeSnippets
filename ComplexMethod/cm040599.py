def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(

):
    """Computes how often integer targets are in the top `K` predictions.

    Args:
        y_true: A tensor of shape `(batch_size)` representing indices or IDs of
            true categories.
        y_pred: If `from_sorted_ids=False`, a tensor of shape
            `(batch_size, num_categories)` containing the scores for each sample
            for all possible categories. If `from_sorted_ids=True`, a tensor of
            shape `(batch_size, N)` containing indices or IDs of the top `N`
            categories in order from highest score to lowest score.
        k: (Optional) Number of top elements to look at for computing accuracy.
            Defaults to `5`.
        from_sorted_ids: (Optional) Whether `y_pred` is sorted category IDs or
            scores for all categories (the default).

    Returns:
        A tensor with the same shape as `y_true` containing ones where `y_true`
        is in the top `k` and zeros elsewhere.
