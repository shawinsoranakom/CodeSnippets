        Default sampling function which uniformly samples the desired number of frames between 0 and total number of frames.
        If `fps` is passed along with metadata, `fps` frames per second are sampled uniformty. Arguments `num_frames`
        and `fps` are mutually exclusive.

        Args:
            video (`torch.Tensor`):
                Video that need to be sampled.
            metadata (`VideoMetadata`):
                Metadata of the video containing information about total duration, fps and total number of frames.
            num_frames (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum number of frames to sample. Defaults to `self.num_frames`.
            fps (`int` or `float`, *optional*):
                Target frames to sample per second. Defaults to `self.fps`.
