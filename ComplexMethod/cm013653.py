    r"""Compute sums, means or maxes of `bags` of embeddings.

    Calculation is done without instantiating the intermediate embeddings.
    See :class:`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` for more details.

    Note:
        {backward_reproducibility_note}

    Args:
        input (LongTensor): Tensor containing bags of indices into the embedding matrix
        weight (Tensor): The embedding matrix with number of rows equal to the maximum possible index + 1,
            and number of columns equal to the embedding size
        offsets (LongTensor, optional): Only used when :attr:`input` is 1D. :attr:`offsets` determines
                             the starting index position of each bag (sequence) in :attr:`input`.
        max_norm (float, optional): If given, each embedding vector with norm larger than :attr:`max_norm`
                                    is renormalized to have norm :attr:`max_norm`.
                                    Note: this will modify :attr:`weight` in-place.
        norm_type (float, optional): The ``p`` in the ``p``-norm to compute for the :attr:`max_norm` option.
                                     Default ``2``.
        scale_grad_by_freq (bool, optional): if given, this will scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of
                                                the words in the mini-batch. Default ``False``.
                                                Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        mode (str, optional): ``"sum"``, ``"mean"`` or ``"max"``. Specifies the way to reduce the bag.
                                 Default: ``"mean"``
        sparse (bool, optional): if ``True``, gradient w.r.t. :attr:`weight` will be a sparse tensor. See Notes under
                                 :class:`torch.nn.Embedding` for more details regarding sparse gradients.
                                 Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        per_sample_weights (Tensor, optional): a tensor of float / double weights, or None
            to indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, :attr:`per_sample_weights`
            must have exactly the same shape as input and is treated as having the same
            :attr:`offsets`, if those are not None.

        include_last_offset (bool, optional): if ``True``, the size of offsets is equal to the number of bags + 1.
                                              The last element is the size of the input, or the ending index position
                                              of the last bag (sequence). This matches the CSR format. Ignored when
                                              input is 2D. Default ``False``.

        padding_idx (int, optional): If specified, the entries at :attr:`padding_idx` do not contribute to the
                                     gradient; therefore, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is not updated
                                     during training, i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad". Note that the embedding
                                     vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is excluded from the reduction.

    Shape:
        - :attr:`input` (LongTensor) and :attr:`offsets` (LongTensor, optional)

          - If :attr:`input` is 2D of shape `(B, N)`, it will be treated as ``B`` bags (sequences)
            each of fixed length ``N``, and this will return ``B`` values aggregated in a way
            depending on the :attr:`mode`. :attr:`offsets` is ignored and required to be ``None`` in this case.

          - If :attr:`input` is 1D of shape `(N)`, it will be treated as a concatenation of
            multiple bags (sequences). :attr:`offsets` is required to be a 1D tensor containing
            the starting index positions of each bag in :attr:`input`. Therefore, for :attr:`offsets`
            of shape `(B)`, :attr:`input` will be viewed as having ``B`` bags.
            Empty bags (i.e., having 0-length) will have returned vectors filled by zeros.

        - :attr:`weight` (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape `(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)`

        - :attr:`per_sample_weights` (Tensor, optional). Has the same shape as :attr:`input`.

        - :attr:`output`: aggregated embedding values of shape `(B, embedding_dim)`
