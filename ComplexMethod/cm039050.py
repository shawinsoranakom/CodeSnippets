        """Incrementally fit a separate model for each class output.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The input data.

        y : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
            Multi-output targets.

        classes : list of ndarray of shape (n_outputs,), default=None
            Each array is unique classes for one output in str/int.
            Can be obtained via
            ``[np.unique(y[:, i]) for i in range(y.shape[1])]``, where `y`
            is the target matrix of the entire dataset.
            This argument is required for the first call to partial_fit
            and can be omitted in the subsequent calls.
            Note that `y` doesn't need to contain all labels in `classes`.

        sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
            Sample weights. If `None`, then samples are equally weighted.
            Only supported if the underlying regressor supports sample
            weights.

        **partial_fit_params : dict of str -> object
            Parameters passed to the ``estimator.partial_fit`` method of each
            sub-estimator.

            Only available if `enable_metadata_routing=True`. See the
            :ref:`User Guide <metadata_routing>`.

        self : object
            Returns a fitted instance.
