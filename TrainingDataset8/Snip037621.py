        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            A short label explaining to the user what this input is for.
            The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following
            elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

            For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="")
            but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow
            empty labels by raising an exception.
        value : object
            The text value of this widget when it first renders. This will be
            cast to str internally.
        height : int or None
            Desired height of the UI element expressed in pixels. If None, a
            default height is used.
        max_chars : int or None
            Maximum number of characters allowed in text area.
        key : str or int
            An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget.
            If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget
            based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may
            not share the same key.
        help : str
            An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the textarea.
        on_change : callable
            An optional callback invoked when this text_area's value changes.
        args : tuple
            An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.
        kwargs : dict
            An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.
        placeholder : str or None
            An optional string displayed when the text area is empty. If None,
            no text is displayed. This argument can only be supplied by keyword.
        disabled : bool
            An optional boolean, which disables the text area if set to True.
            The default is False. This argument can only be supplied by keyword.
        label_visibility : "visible" or "hidden" or "collapsed"
            The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there
            is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label="").
            If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is
            "visible". This argument can only be supplied by keyword.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The current value of the text input widget.
