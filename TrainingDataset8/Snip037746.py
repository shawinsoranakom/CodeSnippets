    """Replay the st element function calls that happened when executing a
    cache-decorated function.

    When a cache function is executed, we record the element and block messages
    produced, and use those to reproduce the DeltaGenerator calls, so the elements
    will appear in the web app even when execution of the function is skipped
    because the result was cached.

    To make this work, for each st function call we record an identifier for the
    DG it was effectively called on (see Note [DeltaGenerator method invocation]).
    We also record the identifier for each DG returned by an st function call, if
    it returns one. Then, for each recorded message, we get the current DG instance
    corresponding to the DG the message was originally called on, and enqueue the
    message using that, recording any new DGs produced in case a later st function
    call is on one of them.
