    Refer - The `Kullback-Leibler divergence Loss
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback-Leibler_divergence>`__

    See :class:`~torch.nn.KLDivLoss` for details.

    Args:
        input: Tensor of arbitrary shape in log-probabilities.
        target: Tensor of the same shape as input. See :attr:`log_target` for
            the target's interpretation.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'batchmean'`` | ``'sum'`` | ``'mean'``.
            ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied
            ``'batchmean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the batchsize
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed
            ``'mean'``: the output will be divided by the number of elements in the output
            Default: ``'mean'``
        log_target (bool): A flag indicating whether ``target`` is passed in the log space.
            It is recommended to pass certain distributions (like ``softmax``)
            in the log space to avoid numerical issues caused by explicit ``log``.
            Default: ``False``

    .. note::
        :attr:`size_average` and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated,
        and in the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`.

    .. warning::
        :attr:`reduction` = ``'mean'`` doesn't return the true kl divergence value, please use
        :attr:`reduction` = ``'batchmean'`` which aligns with KL math definition.
