    Parameters
    ----------

    X : {ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The original data array. If sparse, must be in CSR format.

    x_squared_norms : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Squared euclidean norm of each data point.

    sample_weight : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The weights for each observation in `X`.

    centers : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        The cluster centers before the current iteration

    centers_new : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        The cluster centers after the current iteration. Modified in-place.

    weight_sums : ndarray of shape (n_clusters,)
        The vector in which we keep track of the numbers of points in a
        cluster. This array is modified in place.

    random_state : RandomState instance
        Determines random number generation for low count centers reassignment.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    random_reassign : boolean, default=False
        If True, centers with very low counts are randomly reassigned
        to observations.

    reassignment_ratio : float, default=0.01
        Control the fraction of the maximum number of counts for a
        center to be reassigned. A higher value means that low count
        centers are more likely to be reassigned, which means that the
        model will take longer to converge, but should converge in a
        better clustering.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Controls the verbosity.

    n_threads : int, default=1
        The number of OpenMP threads to use for the computation.

    Returns

    inertia : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.
