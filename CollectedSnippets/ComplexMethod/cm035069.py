    """Computes BLEU score of translated segments against one or more references.

    Args:
      reference_corpus: list of lists of references for each translation. Each
          reference should be tokenized into a list of tokens.
      translation_corpus: list of translations to score. Each translation
          should be tokenized into a list of tokens.
      max_order: Maximum n-gram order to use when computing BLEU score.
      smooth: Whether or not to apply Lin et al. 2004 smoothing.

    Returns:
      3-Tuple with the BLEU score, n-gram precisions, geometric mean of n-gram
      precisions and brevity penalty.
