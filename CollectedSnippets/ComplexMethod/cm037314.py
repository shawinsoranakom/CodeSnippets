    """
    Generates the KV cache configurations for a model.
    Since we use a shared centralized controller for all workers, we need the
    `kv_cache_config` to be consistent across all workers to make sure
    the KV cache allocation can be applied to all workers. However, different
    workers may have different memory available, and different type of layers
    (when pipeline parallel is enabled). To handle the difference between
    workers, the current implementation is:
    1. Merge the KV cache specs of all workers to get the KVCacheSpecs for
       the whole model.
    2. Generate the KV cache groups based on the layer ratio of the whole model.
       This also handles spec unification for hybrid models.
    3. Handle auto-fit max_model_len and memory checks using per-worker
       projected groups to account for PP sharding.
    4. Generate the KV cache configs for each worker based on the KV cache
       grouping strategy. (This is reasonable because the layer ratio of
       different PP stages are similar.)
    5. Change the num_blocks of each worker to the smallest among all workers
       and shrink tensor sizes proportionally to avoid allocating unused memory.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig
        kv_cache_specs: List of dict[layer_name, KVCacheSpec] for each worker.
        available_memory: Memory available for KV cache in bytes for each
            worker.

    Returns:
        The generated KVCacheConfigs for each worker.
