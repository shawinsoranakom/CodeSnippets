        """Mark inputs based on which Tensors are updated using gradients.

        The process for differentiating between inputs and activations is more
        involved. Most Tensors in a training loop depend on at least one
        gradient: parameters depend on them through updates, and activations
        and optimizer state depend on them transitively through parameters.
        Critically, we do not need to know which Tensors are parameters to
        apply this method; we can simply walk the data flow graph to build the
        set of all values which depend on a gradient and then obtain the set
        of inputs from the conjugate set.

        There is, however, one hiccup. The first time we see a parameter is
        generally on the forward pass of the first step. We know from
        inspection of the data flow graph that v1 of that Tensor depends on
        a gradient (provided we profile an optimizer step), but not v0. To
        address this problem we weaken the definition of "depends on a
        gradient" to "any version of this Tensor depends on a gradient",
        which in turn strengthens the criteria for the input set enough to
        filter the activations in the forward pass of the first step."""
