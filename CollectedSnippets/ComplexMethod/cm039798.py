    """Used by Logistic Regression (and CV) and LinearSVC/LinearSVR.

    Preprocessing is done in this function before supplying it to liblinear.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training vector, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and
        `n_features` is the number of features.

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Target vector relative to X

    C : float
        Inverse of cross-validation parameter. The lower the C, the higher
        the penalization.

    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether or not to fit an intercept. If set to True, the feature vector
        is extended to include an intercept term: ``[x_1, ..., x_n, 1]``, where
        1 corresponds to the intercept. If set to False, no intercept will be
        used in calculations (i.e. data is expected to be already centered).

    intercept_scaling : float
        Liblinear internally penalizes the intercept, treating it like any
        other term in the feature vector. To reduce the impact of the
        regularization on the intercept, the `intercept_scaling` parameter can
        be set to a value greater than 1; the higher the value of
        `intercept_scaling`, the lower the impact of regularization on it.
        Then, the weights become `[w_x_1, ..., w_x_n,
        w_intercept*intercept_scaling]`, where `w_x_1, ..., w_x_n` represent
        the feature weights and the intercept weight is scaled by
        `intercept_scaling`. This scaling allows the intercept term to have a
        different regularization behavior compared to the other features.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

    penalty : {'l1', 'l2'}
        The norm of the penalty used in regularization.

    dual : bool
        Dual or primal formulation,

    verbose : int
        Set verbose to any positive number for verbosity.

    max_iter : int
        Number of iterations.

    tol : float
        Stopping condition.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the pseudo random number generation for shuffling the data.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    multi_class : {'ovr', 'crammer_singer'}, default='ovr'
        `ovr` trains n_classes one-vs-rest classifiers, while `crammer_singer`
        optimizes a joint objective over all classes.
        While `crammer_singer` is interesting from a theoretical perspective
        as it is consistent it is seldom used in practice and rarely leads to
        better accuracy and is more expensive to compute.
        If `crammer_singer` is chosen, the options loss, penalty and dual will
        be ignored.

    loss : {'logistic_regression', 'hinge', 'squared_hinge', \
            'epsilon_insensitive', 'squared_epsilon_insensitive}, \
            default='logistic_regression'
        The loss function used to fit the model.

    epsilon : float, default=0.1
        Epsilon parameter in the epsilon-insensitive loss function. Note
        that the value of this parameter depends on the scale of the target
        variable y. If unsure, set epsilon=0.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Weights assigned to each sample.

    Returns
    -------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features + 1)
        The coefficient vector got by minimizing the objective function.

    intercept_ : float
        The intercept term added to the vector.

    n_iter_ : array of int
        Number of iterations run across for each class.
