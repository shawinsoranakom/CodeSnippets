def narrow(

) -> Tensor:
    r"""
    Constructs a nested tensor (which might be a view) from :attr:`tensor`, a strided tensor. This follows
    similar semantics to torch.Tensor.narrow, where in the :attr:`dim`-th dimension the new nested tensor
    shows only the elements in the interval `[start, start+length)`. As nested representations
    allow for a different `start` and `length` at each 'row' of that dimension, :attr:`start` and :attr:`length`
    can also be tensors of shape `tensor.shape[0]`.

    There's some differences depending on the layout you use for the nested tensor. If using strided layout,
    torch.narrow will do a copy of the narrowed data into a contiguous NT with strided layout, while
    jagged layout narrow() will create a non-contiguous view of your original strided tensor. This particular
    representation is really useful for representing kv-caches in Transformer models, as specialized
    SDPA kernels can deal with format easily, resulting in performance improvements.


    Args:
        tensor (:class:`torch.Tensor`): a strided tensor, which will be used as the underlying data
            for the nested tensor if using the jagged layout or will be copied for the strided layout.
        dim (int): the dimension where narrow will be applied. Only `dim=1` is supported for the
            jagged layout, while strided supports all dim
        start (Union[int, :class:`torch.Tensor`]): starting element for the narrow operation
        length (Union[int, :class:`torch.Tensor`]): number of elements taken during the narrow op

    Keyword arguments:
        layout (:class:`torch.layout`, optional): the desired layout of returned nested tensor.
            Only strided and jagged layouts are supported. Default: if None, the strided layout.

    Example::

        >>> starts = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=torch.int64)
        >>> lengths = torch.tensor([3, 2, 2, 1, 5], dtype=torch.int64)
        >>> narrow_base = torch.randn(5, 10, 20)
        >>> nt_narrowed = torch.nested.narrow(narrow_base, 1, starts, lengths, layout=torch.jagged)
        >>> nt_narrowed.is_contiguous()
        False
