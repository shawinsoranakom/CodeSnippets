        `ClvpFeatureExtractor` is used to extract various voice specific properties such as the pitch and tone of the
        voice, speaking speed, and even speaking defects like a lisp or stuttering from a sample voice or `raw_speech`.

        First the voice is padded or truncated in a way such that it becomes a waveform of `self.default_audio_length`
        seconds long and then the log-mel spectrogram is extracted from it.

        Args:
            raw_speech (`np.ndarray`, `list[float]`, `list[np.ndarray]`, `list[list[float]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be padded. Each sequence can be a numpy array, a list of float
                values, a list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values. Must be mono channel audio, not
                stereo, i.e. single float per timestep.
            sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*):
                The sampling rate at which the `raw_speech` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
                `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors and allow automatic speech recognition
                pipeline.
            truncation (`bool`, *optional*, default to `True`):
                Activates truncation to cut input sequences longer than *max_length* to *max_length*.
            pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
                If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

                This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
                `>= 7.5` (Volta), or on TPUs which benefit from having sequence lengths be a multiple of 128.
            return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether to return the attention mask. If left to the default, it will return the attention mask.

                [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
            padding_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
                The value that is used to fill the padding values / vectors.
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                The maximum input length of the inputs.
