    Broadcasts the data payload from rank 0 to all other ranks.
    Or if a function is passed, execute it in rank 0 and broadcast result to all other ranks.

    Can be used to broadcast a failure signal to stop all ranks.

    If the function raises an exception, all ranks will raise.

    Args:
        data_or_fn: the data to broadcast or function to execute and broadcast result.
        success: False to stop all ranks.
        stage_name: the name of the logical stage for synchronization and debugging
        rank: rank to broadcast data or execute function and broadcast results.
        pg: the process group for sync
    Throws:

    Returns:
