        From a `pretrained_model_name_or_path`, resolve to a dictionary of parameters, to be used for instantiating a
        image processor of type [`~image_processor_utils.ImageProcessingMixin`] using `from_dict`.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                The identifier of the pre-trained checkpoint from which we want the dictionary of parameters.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            image_processor_filename (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"config.json"`):
                The name of the file in the model directory to use for the image processor config.

        Returns:
            `tuple[Dict, Dict]`: The dictionary(ies) that will be used to instantiate the image processor object.
