        """ Generalized logic to retrieve the next question or page to show on the survey.
        It's based on the page_or_question_id parameter, that is usually the currently displayed question/page.

        There is a special case when the survey is configured with conditional questions:
        - for "page_per_question" layout, the next question to display depends on the selected answers and
          the questions 'hierarchy'.
        - for "page_per_section" layout, before returning the result, we check that it contains at least a question
          (all section questions could be disabled based on previously selected answers)

        The whole logic is inverted if "go_back" is passed as True.

        As pages with description are considered as potential question to display, we show the page
        if it contains at least one active question or a description.

        :param user_input: user's answers
        :param page_or_question_id: current page or question id
        :param go_back: reverse the logic and get the PREVIOUS question/page
