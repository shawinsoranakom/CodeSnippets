    """Automatically extract clusters according to the Xi-steep method.

    This is rouphly an implementation of Figure 19 of the OPTICS paper.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reachability_plot : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        The reachability plot, i.e. reachability ordered according to
        the calculated ordering, all computed by OPTICS.

    predecessor_plot : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predecessors ordered according to the calculated ordering.

    xi : float, between 0 and 1
        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that
        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the
        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its
        successor being at most 1-xi.

    min_samples : int > 1
        The same as the min_samples given to OPTICS. Up and down steep regions
        can't have more then ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster.

    predecessor_correction : bool
        Correct clusters based on the calculated predecessors.

    Returns
    -------
    clusters : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)
        The list of clusters in the form of [start, end] in each row, with all
        indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered in a way that larger
        clusters encompassing smaller clusters come after those smaller
        clusters.
