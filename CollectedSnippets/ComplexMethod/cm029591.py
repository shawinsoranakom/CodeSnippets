def circle(self, radius, extent = None, steps = None):
        """ Draw a circle with given radius.

        Arguments:
        radius -- a number
        extent (optional) -- a number
        steps (optional) -- an integer

        Draw a circle with given radius. The center is radius units left
        of the turtle; extent - an angle - determines which part of the
        circle is drawn. If extent is not given, draw the entire circle.
        If extent is not a full circle, one endpoint of the arc is the
        current pen position. Draw the arc in counterclockwise direction
        if radius is positive, otherwise in clockwise direction. Finally
        the direction of the turtle is changed by the amount of extent.

        As the circle is approximated by an inscribed regular polygon,
        steps determines the number of steps to use. If not given,
        it will be calculated automatically. Maybe used to draw regular
        polygons.

        call: circle(radius)                  # full circle
        --or: circle(radius, extent)          # arc
        --or: circle(radius, extent, steps)
        --or: circle(radius, steps=6)         # 6-sided polygon

        Example (for a Turtle instance named turtle):
        >>> turtle.circle(50)
        >>> turtle.circle(120, 180)  # semicircle
