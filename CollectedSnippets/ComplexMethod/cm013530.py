        Generates a list of guards strings which, when evaluated in a context that
        defines tensors for all the sources, returns True or False depending
        on if the guards in the list evaluated to True or not.  Primarily used by Dynamo,
        but this is also helpful for manual testing of guards (see

        simplified lets you omit duck sizing, equality and 0/1 guards.

        guards, and it may be helpful for user output too (be careful though;
        some equality guards are nontrivial!  It would be nice to get simplified

        # It took a lot of sweat to figure out the algorithm here.  Let's
        # explain how it works.
        #
        # The ShapeEnv lifecycle looks something like this:
        #
        # - For each input, you either generate a fresh Sympy symbol (s0) to
        #   represent its value (a binding site), or you reuse some
        #   preexisting symbol or expression, skipping the symbol allocation
        #   (e.g., duck sizing to a preexisting symbol, or expressing a
        #   stride as a multiplication of a separate stride and size.)
        #   Naively, you might expect to bind a fresh Sympy symbol for
        #   every input, but this is fairly wasteful as most of these
        #   symbols immediately simplify away, and if you don't eagerly
        #   specialize, e.g., 0/1 symbols, you end up with very complicated
        #   expressions that are not optimizable in practice.
        #
        # - You perform some compute on these symbols, occasionally
        #   introducing guards on boolean expressions on these symbols.
        #   In particular, whenever we guard on equality (_maybe_guard_rel),
        #   we can simplify shapes; e.g., when s0 == s1 * 2, we can now
        #   replace all occurrences of s0 with s1 * 2.  Sometimes, a
        #   boolean expression evaluation doesn't introduce a guard, as
        #   the guard is already entailed by the simplifications we have
        #   applied.
        #
        # - In the end, you have a bunch of replacements (saying how to
        #   simplify shapes) and a bunch of guards (all the equality guards
        #   are trivial, because they're covered by the replacements).
        #
        # From the ShapeEnv, we must generate a Python expression that, when
        # evaluated on a set of inputs, tells us whether or not these boolean
        # expressions would have evaluated in the same way.  However,
        # we cannot easily compute this, as we elide recording boolean
        # expressions when we think they are vacuously true.  Thus, we seek
        # an approximation: we must generate an expression, if true, would have
        # produced an "equivalent" ShapeEnv, which would answer guard
        # expressions in the same way.
        #
        # Our notion of equivalence is a bit subtle.  For example, consider
        # the ShapeEnv created from an input of size (5, 4) versus (4, 4)
        # (no other guards.)  Duck sizing would generate (s0, s1) in the first
        # case but (s0, s0) in the second.  We do NOT assume that size
        # variables are disjoint; so in fact a graph that assumes the input
        # could be (s0, s1) subsumes (s0, s0) (setting s0 == s1), but not
        # vice versa.  However, consider an analogous case (1,) versus (2,).
        # Duck sizing generates (1,) and (s0,); the (s0,) graph does NOT
        # subsume the (1,) graph because we assume that any size variables
        # is NOT 0/1 (and make simplifications according to this; e.g., if
        # we queried s0 == 0, we would immediately return False without
        # returning a guard.)
        #
        # So, it is perhaps easier to flip things on their head: the guard
        # expressions we generate here say what simplifications are valid,
        # and what are not. Below, we explain each of the guard expressions
        # we generate

        # TODO: Make this more efficient by binding all the size/stride/offsets
        # to locals before performing tests on them.

        #   matches the old sizes the guard fails and the input falls through
        #   to Graph_old, which is guaranteed to accept it.
        #
        # Theorem: For graphs G0, ..., Gn compiled via progressive dynamism
        # (one dim per step), each input is accepted by at most one graph.
        #
        #   Setup: G0 is all-static with shape S. Gk is created by making
        #   dim d_k dynamic, with exclusion guard d_k != S[d_k].
        #
        #   Proof by induction on n:
        #
        #   Base case (n=0): Only G0, all-static. Trivially unique.
        #
        #   Inductive step: Assume the property holds for G0, ..., G_{n-1}.
        #   We add Gn with newly-dynamic dim d_n and exclusion d_n != S[d_n].
        #
        #   For any input X that passes Gn's shape guards, exactly one of:
        #
        #   Case A — exclusion passes (X[d_n] != S[d_n]):
        #     Dim d_n is static in all G0, ..., G_{n-1} with value S[d_n],
        #     so X fails all prior graphs on that dim. Only Gn accepts X.
        #
        #   Case B — exclusion rejects (X[d_n] == S[d_n]):
        #     X matches Gn's shape guards on all other dims, and matches
        #     the static value for d_n. So X satisfies G_{n-1}'s shape
        #     guards. By the inductive hypothesis, exactly one of
        #     G0, ..., G_{n-1} accepts X. Gn rejects X.
        #
        #   Corollary: Evaluation order does not affect correctness.
        #
        # All exclusion pairs across all tensors and scalars are flattened
        # into a single list — each pair is just (symbol, excluded_int),
        # and the multi-tensor case is the same logic as multi-dim within
        # one tensor.  The combined Or rejects only when ALL pairs match
        # simultaneously, which is the exact condition for Graph_old to
        # accept.  If the current concrete values already match every
        # excluded value the guard is skipped (it would fail on creation).
