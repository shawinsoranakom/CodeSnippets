def as_completed(fs, timeout=None):
    """An iterator over the given futures that yields each as it completes.

    Args:
        fs: The sequence of Futures (possibly created by different Executors) to
            iterate over.
        timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait. If None, then there
            is no limit on the wait time.

    Returns:
        An iterator that yields the given Futures as they complete (finished or
        cancelled). If any given Futures are duplicated, they will be returned
        once.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If the entire result iterator could not be generated
            before the given timeout.
