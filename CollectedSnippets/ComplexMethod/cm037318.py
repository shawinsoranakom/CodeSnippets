        For chunked local attention, we need to find the longest cache hit
        prefix of the blocks that is not longer than `max_length`. The prefix
        should be a common prefix hit for all the kv cache groups in
        `kv_cache_group_ids`. If no cache hit is found, return an empty list.
        note we mark as computed if the whole block is outside of the local
        window, and set the block as null. Examples:

        1. Attention chunk size of 8, block size of 4, max length of 15
        for next token at 15th (zero-indexed), 8th - 14th tokens are in
        the window(needs lookup), 0th - 7th are not in the window,
        so they are already marked as computed. We check the complete
        block3 (8th - 11th tokens), Assume block 3 is hit, we will return
        [null, null, block 3], otherwise, we return [null, null]

        2. Attention chunk size of 8, block size of 4, max length of 16
        for next token at 16th (zero-indexed), 0th - 15th tokens are not
        in the window, so they are already marked as computed.
        we return 4 blocks[null, null, null, null]

        Args:
            block_hashes: The block hashes of the request.
            max_length: The maximum length of the cache hit prefix.
            kv_cache_group_ids: The ids of the kv cache groups.
            block_pool: The block pool.
            kv_cache_spec: The kv cache spec.
            use_eagle: Whether to use eagle.
            dcp_world_size: The world size of decode context parallelism.
            pcp_world_size: The world size of prefill context parallelism.
            alignment_tokens: The returned cache hit length (in tokens) should
                be a multiple of this value (in tokens).

        Returns:
            A list of cached blocks
