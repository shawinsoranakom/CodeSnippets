def _allocate_leads(self, creation_delta_days=7):
        """ Allocate leads to teams given by self. This method sets ``team_id``
        field on lead records that are unassigned (no team and no responsible).
        No salesperson is assigned in this process. Its purpose is simply to
        allocate leads within teams.

        This process allocates all available leads on teams weighted by their
        maximum assignment by month that indicates their relative workload.

        Heuristic of this method is the following:
          * find unassigned leads for each team, aka leads being
            * without team, without user -> not assigned;
            * not won nor inactive -> live leads;
            * created in the last creation_delta_days (in the last week by default)
              This avoid to take into account old leads in the allocation.
            * if set, a delay after creation can be applied (see BUNDLE_HOURS_DELAY)
              parameter explanations here below;
            * matching the team's assignment domain (empty means
              everything);

          * assign a weight to each team based on their assignment_max that
            indicates their relative workload;

          * pick a random team using a weighted random choice and find a lead
            to assign:

            * remove already assigned leads from the available leads. If there
              is not any lead spare to assign, remove team from active teams;
            * pick the first lead and set the current team;
            * when setting a team on leads, leads are also merged with their
              duplicates. Purpose is to clean database and avoid assigning
              duplicates to same or different teams;
            * add lead and its duplicates to already assigned leads;

          * pick another random team until their is no more leads to assign
            to any team;

        This process ensure that teams having overlapping domains will all
        receive leads as lead allocation is done one lead at a time. This
        allocation will be proportional to their size (assignment of their
        members).

        Supported ``ir.config_parameter`` settings.

        ``crm.assignment.bundle``
            deprecated

        ``crm.assignment.commit.bundle`` (``int``)
            Allow to set size of lead batch to be committed together. By
            default 100 which is a good trade-off between transaction time and
            speed.

        ``crm.assignment.delay`` (``float``)
            Give a delay before taking a lead into assignment process
            (BUNDLE_HOURS_DELAY) given in hours. Purpose if to allow other
            crons or automation rules to make their job. This option is mainly
            historic as its purpose was to let automation rules prepare leads
            and score before PLS was added into CRM. This is now not required
            anymore but still supported;
