    # - Both the audios and the mel spectrograms are saved as numpy arrays
    # - There is no processing done to the audios that will be saved to disk beyond volume
    #   normalization (in split_on_silences)
    # - However, pre-emphasis is applied to the audios before computing the mel spectrogram. This
    #   is why we re-apply it on the audio on the side of the vocoder.
    # - Librosa pads the waveform before computing the mel spectrogram. Here, the waveform is saved
    #   without extra padding. This means that you won't have an exact relation between the length
    #   of the wav and of the mel spectrogram. See the vocoder data loader.
