        Compute the necessary table joins for the passage through the fields
        given in 'names'. 'opts' is the Options class for the current model
        (which gives the table we are starting from), 'alias' is the alias for
        the table to start the joining from.

        The 'can_reuse' defines the reverse foreign key joins we can reuse. It
        can be None in which case all joins are reusable or a set of aliases
        that can be reused. Note that non-reverse foreign keys are always
        reusable when using setup_joins().

        If 'allow_many' is False, then any reverse foreign key seen will
        generate a MultiJoin exception.

        Return the final field involved in the joins, the target field (used
        for any 'where' constraint), the final 'opts' value, the joins, the
        field path traveled to generate the joins, and a transform function
        that takes a field and alias and is equivalent to
        `field.get_col(alias)` in the simple case but wraps field transforms if
        they were included in names.

        The target field is the field containing the concrete value. Final
        field can be something different, for example foreign key pointing to
        that value. Final field is needed for example in some value
        conversions (convert 'obj' in fk__id=obj to pk val using the foreign
        key field for example).
