def incr_mean_variance_axis(X, *, axis, last_mean, last_var, last_n, weights=None):
    """Compute incremental mean and variance along an axis on a CSR or CSC matrix.

    last_mean, last_var are the statistics computed at the last step by this
    function. Both must be initialized to 0-arrays of the proper size, i.e.
    the number of features in X. last_n is the number of samples encountered
    until now.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : CSR or CSC sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data.

    axis : {0, 1}
        Axis along which the axis should be computed.

    last_mean : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating
        Array of means to update with the new data X.
        Should be of shape (n_features,) if axis=0 or (n_samples,) if axis=1.

    last_var : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating
        Array of variances to update with the new data X.
        Should be of shape (n_features,) if axis=0 or (n_samples,) if axis=1.

    last_n : float or ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), \
            dtype=floating
        Sum of the weights seen so far, excluding the current weights
        If not float, it should be of shape (n_features,) if
        axis=0 or (n_samples,) if axis=1. If float it corresponds to
        having same weights for all samples (or features).

    weights : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_features,), default=None
        If axis is set to 0 shape is (n_samples,) or
        if axis is set to 1 shape is (n_features,).
        If it is set to None, then samples are equally weighted.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Returns
    -------
    means : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating
        Updated feature-wise means if axis = 0 or
        sample-wise means if axis = 1.

    variances : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating
        Updated feature-wise variances if axis = 0 or
        sample-wise variances if axis = 1.

    n : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=integral
        Updated number of seen samples per feature if axis=0
        or number of seen features per sample if axis=1.

        If weights is not None, n is a sum of the weights of the seen
        samples or features instead of the actual number of seen
        samples or features.

    NaNs are ignored in the algorithm.
