    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        A short, descriptive name for the component. Like, "slider".
    path: str or None
        The path to serve the component's frontend files from. Either
        `path` or `url` must be specified, but not both.
    url: str or None
        The URL that the component is served from. Either `path` or `url`

    Returns
    -------
    CustomComponent
        A CustomComponent that can be called like a function.
        Calling the component will create a new instance of the component
        in the Streamlit app.
