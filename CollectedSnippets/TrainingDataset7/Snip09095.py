    Return URL-safe, hmac signed base64 compressed JSON string. If key is
    None, use settings.SECRET_KEY instead. The hmac algorithm is the default
    Signer algorithm.

    If compress is True (not the default), check if compressing using zlib can
    save some space. Prepend a '.' to signify compression. This is included
    in the signature, to protect against zip bombs.

    Salt can be used to namespace the hash, so that a signed string is
    only valid for a given namespace. Leaving this at the default
    value or re-using a salt value across different parts of your
    application without good cause is a security risk.

    The serializer is expected to return a bytestring.
