def smart_split(text):
    r"""
    Generator that splits a string by spaces, leaving quoted phrases together.
    Supports both single and double quotes, and supports escaping quotes with
    backslashes. In the output, strings will keep their initial and trailing
    quote marks and escaped quotes will remain escaped (the results can then
    be further processed with unescape_string_literal()).

    >>> list(smart_split(r'This is "a person\'s" test.'))
    ['This', 'is', '"a person\\\'s"', 'test.']
    >>> list(smart_split(r"Another 'person\'s' test."))
    ['Another', "'person\\'s'", 'test.']
    >>> list(smart_split(r'A "\"funky\" style" test.'))
    ['A', '"\\"funky\\" style"', 'test.']
