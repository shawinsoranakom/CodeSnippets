        #    - cols_start, cols_end: usually the columns in the row are
        #      in the same order model_cls.__init__ expects them, so we
        #      can instantiate by model_cls(*row[cols_start:cols_end])
        #    - reorder_for_init: When select_related descends to a child
        #      class, then we want to reuse the already selected parent
        #      data. However, in this case the parent data isn't necessarily
        #      in the same order that Model.__init__ expects it to be, so
        #      we have to reorder the parent data. The reorder_for_init
        #      attribute contains a function used to reorder the field data
        #      in the order __init__ expects it.
        #  - pk_idx: the index of the primary key field in the reordered
        #    model data. Used to check if a related object exists at all.
        #  - init_list: the field attnames fetched from the database. For
        #    deferred models this isn't the same as all attnames of the
        #    model's fields.
        #  - related_populators: a list of RelatedPopulator instances if
        #    select_related() descends to related models from this model.
        #  - local_setter, remote_setter: Methods to set cached values on
        #    the object being populated and on the remote object. Usually
        #    these are Field.set_cached_value() methods.
